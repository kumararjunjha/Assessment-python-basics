    "# Python Basics Questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is popular because it supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, and functional), has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks, and is easy to learn for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "An interpreter in Python is a software that executes code line by line, converting high-level Python code into machine-readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    "Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python with specific meanings and purposes, such as `if`, `else`, `while`, `True`, and `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for specific functionalities in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    "Mutability in Python refers to an object’s ability to be changed after it is created. Mutable objects (e.g., lists) can be modified, while immutable objects (e.g., tuples) cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "Lists are designed to be flexible and modifiable, whereas tuples are meant to be fixed collections, ensuring their contents cannot be altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    "The `==` operator checks for value equality, while the `is` operator checks for object identity (whether two objects refer to the same memory location).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
    "Logical operators in Python are `and`, `or`, and `not`. They are used to perform logical operations and return boolean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "Type casting is converting a variable from one data type to another, such as converting an integer to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "- Implicit type casting is performed automatically by Python (e.g., int to float).\n",
    "- Explicit type casting requires manual intervention using functions like `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "Conditional statements control the flow of a program by executing different code blocks based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
    "The `elif` statement checks additional conditions if the previous `if` condition is false. It acts as an \"else if\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "- A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string, range).\n",
    "- A `while` loop executes as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "A `while` loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, such as waiting for user input or processing data until a condition is met.\n"
